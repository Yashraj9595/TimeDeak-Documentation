            <div class="card">
                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                <h3>1. Smart Contract-Based Payments</h3>
                <p><strong>Escrow System:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When a tourist books a service (accommodation, tour, experience), payment is held in a smart contract</li>
                    <li>Funds are released to the service provider only after the service is delivered and confirmed by the tourist</li>
                    <li>If there are disputes, a decentralized arbitration process is triggered</li>
                    <li>The system ensures fair transactions for both tourists and service providers</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Payment Flow:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Tourist selects a service and initiates payment</li>
                    <li>Payment is locked in a smart contract with specific conditions</li>
                    <li>Service provider is notified of the booking</li>
                    <li>After service completion, tourist confirms delivery</li>
                    <li>Smart contract automatically releases payment to the provider</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>2. Verified Service Provider System</h3>
                <p><strong>Blockchain-Based Verification:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Service providers (guides, homestays, artisans) undergo a verification process</li>
                    <li>Verification includes identity checks, skill assessments, and background verification</li>
                    <li>Verified providers receive a blockchain-based digital certificate</li>
                    <li>This certificate is visible to tourists as a trust indicator</li>
                    <li>The verification status cannot be tampered with or falsified</li>
                </ul>
                

                
                <h3>3. Transparent Review System</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reviews and ratings are stored on the blockchain, making them immutable</li>
                    <li>Only verified users who have actually used a service can leave reviews</li>
                    <li>This prevents fake reviews and ensures authentic feedback</li>
                    <li>The system builds a reliable reputation system for service providers</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
